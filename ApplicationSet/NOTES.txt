Installation
kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/applicationset/v0.4.1/manifests/install.yaml

ApplicationSet
- Its a controller and CRD that provides:
    + Automating the application generations
    + More Flexiblity when managing ArgoCD Applications across a large number of clusters
    + Ability to make self-service usage on multitenant clusters

Use cases
- Use a single Kubernetes manifest to deploy into multiple Kubernetes cluster with ArgoCD
- Use a single Kubernetes manifest to deploy multiple application from one or multiple Git repositories with ArgoCD
- Multitenacy support, improves the ability of individual cluster tenants to deploy applications using ArgoCD
Ex: Developers can deploy services into specific cluster/namespace without engaging clusters admins

How it workes
- ApplicationSet controller only responsible of creating, updating and deleting application in ArgoCD namespace
- ApplicationSet does not modify k8s resources. Its Application controller responsibility to deploy resouces into destination clusters

Generators
- Generators are responsible for generating parameters, which are then rendered into application template
- Generators are primarily based on the data source that they use to generate the template parameters
- Generators are responsible for generating parameters and are based on data sources, which can be used to generaters into the application template
- Type of Generators
    + list
    + cluster
    + Git
    + Matrix
    + Merge
    + SCM provider
    + Pull request
    + Cluster Decision resource
